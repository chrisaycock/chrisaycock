I'm the creator of [Empirical](https://www.empirical-soft.com/), a language for time-series analysis.

Previously I spent a decade in quantitative finance, particularly stat arb and HFT. I have my BS and MS from Penn State and my DPhil from Oxford, all in computer science.

I am interested in programming languages, high-performance computing, and systematic trading. I am *not* interested in recruiters or salespeople.
